## üìã Project Roadmap

A checklist-style development roadmap broken into **four core phases**.
The initial version does not include real-time GPS, maps, or live bus tracking.

---

## ‚úÖ Phase I: Static Schedule Viewer

üïê Display posted schedules from GTFS or CSV.

### Tasks:
- <strike> [ ] Download or convert RapidRide's schedule to GTFS or structured CSV </strike>
- <strike> [ ] Parse `routes.txt`, `stops.txt`, `stop_times.txt`, `trips.txt` </strike>
  - Routes are viewed via PDF file, map-based routes/schedules will be implemented later on.
- [x] Build mobile app UI to:
  - [x] Browse by route
  - [x] Show stop times for each route/day
- [ ] Include section for admin-posted alerts

---

## üéü Phase II: Ticket Purchase & QR Code Generator

üõí Generate QR tickets via backend API after Stripe payment.

### Tasks:
- [ ] Build `/buy_ticket` FastAPI endpoint
- [x] Support all ticket types (single, 10-ride, monthly)
- [x] Generate QR code using UUID + expiration metadata
- [ ] Store ticket in Supabase with status tracking
- [ ] Display ticket in mobile app (including expiration countdown)

---

## üõ† Phase III: Admin Dashboard & Ticket Validator

üß∞ Allow drivers or staff to scan QR tickets and post alerts.

### Ticket Validator (C++):
- [ ] Scan QR using OpenCV + ZBar
- [ ] Send UUID to backend `/validate_ticket` endpoint
- [ ] Backend checks:
  - [ ] Valid?
  - [ ] Expired?
  - [ ] Already used?

### Admin Dashboard:
- [ ] Web UI (Flask/FastAPI + simple HTML)
- [ ] Admin login
- [ ] Post service alerts by route or date
- [ ] View ticket usage logs

---

## üìç Phase IV: Nearby Stops via GPS (Future Feature)

üó∫Ô∏è Use phone location to show nearest stops and upcoming scheduled buses (no real-time tracking).

### Tasks:
- [ ] Use phone GPS (via `plyer` or `geopy`)
- [ ] Parse `stops.txt` for coordinates
- [ ] Calculate nearest stops using Haversine distance
- [ ] Show upcoming departures using `stop_times.txt` data

---

## üß± Optional Features

- [ ] Prepaid ticket codes (offline payment compatibility)
- [ ] Ticket gifting (send a ride to someone else)
- [ ] Kiosk mode (install app on public devices)

---

## üîê Security Notes

- Tickets use UUID stored in backend
- QR codes expire or decrement ride count on scan
- Prevent re-use by marking as scanned
- (Optional) Add encryption (e.g., JWT) in later versions

---

## üí∞ Cost Estimate

| Resource          | Cost Estimate       |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Hosting (Render/Railway) | $0‚Äì$7/month    |
| Supabase (DB/Auth) | Free tier covers MVP |
| Stripe Fees        | 2.9% + $0.30/txn    |
| Domain Name        | ~$12/year (optional) |
| Ticket Validator   | Open-source; no cost |
| Dev Tools          | Free (Python/C++)   |
